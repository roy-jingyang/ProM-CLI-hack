# ProM-CLI-hack
Repo holding scripts for interacting with ProM using CLI and testing the invoking of ProM from an external program.

#### What is ProM?
From the [official website](http://www.promtools.org/doku.php) of the ProM project:
> ProM is an extensible framework that supports a wide variety of process mining techniques in the form of plug-ins. It is platform independent as it is implemented in Java, and can be downloaded free of charge.

#### Why do CLI (command-line interface) hack?
Maybe you would want to
> ... run process mining analyses on several logs in batch mode without user interaction.

as quoted from a [blog post](https://dirksmetric.wordpress.com/2015/03/11/tutorial-automating-process-mining-with-proms-command-line-interface/) by Dirk Fahland.

* Or it could be that you want to have some of your own programs working in synergy with ProM but you don't know Java that much.

* Or simply becuase that a sexy Graphical User Interface is brilliant but is not for everyone.

This project is motivated by an issue that I have encountered in my own research, and is largely inspired by Dirk Fahland's blog post (see above) as well as a number of posts from the [ProM forum](https://www.win.tue.nl/promforum/).

Note that this project is for experimental use and does not guarantee any unplanned functionalities, software code compliance or any future maintenance.
